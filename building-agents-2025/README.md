Welcome to the official repository for **Definitive Guide for AI Agents in 2025 - Frameworks, Patterns, Use Cases & Resources**! This repo is the home of the video tutorial designed to help developers understand how to create agents in 2025.

In this video, we explore Anthropic's insights on designing and implementing effective agents using large language models (LLMs). Drawing from their article, Building Effective Agents, we'll break down the core principles and strategies for creating flexible, reliable, and scalable agentic systems. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide provides actionable advice to help you maximize the potential of LLMs in your applications.

This video focuses on the development of AI agents in the year 2025. The document outlines various aspects of agent construction, including:

- **Agent definitions and usage**
- **Frameworks for agent development** (e.g., LangGraph, Microsoft Autogen, Amazon Bedrock, Rivet, Vellum)
- **Distinction between visual and code-based frameworks**
- **Specific coding frameworks** such as LangChain/LangGraph and PydanticAI
- **Use cases and agent patterns**, including:
  - Prompt Chaining
  - Routing
  - Parallelization
  - Orchestrator-Workers
  - Evaluator-Optimizer
- **Considerations for choosing a framework**, such as:
  - Use case criticality
  - Team skills
  - Time and budget constraints
  - Integration requirements
  - AIOps needs
  - Preference for visual, no-code, or low-code approaches
- **Resources** for no-code, low-code, and enterprise tools, as well as educational and community resources.
