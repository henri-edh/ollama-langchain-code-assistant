# üß† Building Mermaid Diagram Agents with smolagents

Welcome to the second tutorial in the **AI IN ACTION** series! In this tutorial, we‚Äôll guide you through building an AI-powered workflow for generating **Mermaid diagrams**. By the end of this guide, you‚Äôll have an agent capable of:

1. Generating a **Mermaid script** based on a user prompt.
2. Converting the Mermaid script into an image.
3. Saving and displaying the generated diagram via a web interface.

---

## **üöÄ What You‚Äôll Build**

This project involves:

- **User Interaction**: A prompt-based interface where users can describe their desired diagram.
- **Diagram Agent**: The agent will generate a Mermaid script from the prompt, convert it to an image, and return the output.
- **Web Interface**: Built using Gradio for seamless user interaction.

This repository serves as a companion to the AI IN ACTION series and its second video tutorial **[Create Stunning Mermaid Diagrams with AI Agents (AI IN ACTION)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7r1PtkxNYg)** which introduces a Mermaid generation pipeline using smolagents from Hugging Face.

## üòç How to Contribute to This Repository

This repository is maintained by the team at **[AI Software Developers](https://www.youtube.com/@AISoftwareDevelopers)** channel. Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please check out the contribution guidelines and submit a PR.

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites**

### **1. System Requirements**

- Python 3.8+
- A valid Hugging Face API key (optional, depending on the models you use).

### **2. Installation**

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install smolagents gradio pillow
```

---

## **üìÇ Project Setup**

### **1. Define the Prompt and Mermaid Script**

Here‚Äôs an example of a sequence diagram:

#### **User Prompt**

"Create a sequence diagram for a login interaction."

#### **Generated Mermaid Script**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server
    User->>Browser: Enter credentials
    Browser->>Server: Validate credentials
    Server-->>Browser: Login successful
    Browser-->>User: Display dashboard
```

### **2. Project Structure**

Your project should include:

- **`main.py`**: The main script to run the agent and Gradio app.
- **`mermaid_agent.py`**: Contains the logic for generating Mermaid scripts and images.

---

## **üë®‚Äçüíª Implementation**

### **1. Writing the Agent**

The `DiagramAgent` will handle generating the Mermaid script and converting it to an image.

#### **mermaid_agent.py**

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
import os

class DiagramAgent(CodeAgent):
    def __init__(self, model, instructions):
        super().__init__(model=model, instructions=instructions)

    def generate_mermaid_script(self, prompt):
        return self.run(prompt)

    def render_mermaid_image(self, script, output_file):
        # Placeholder for converting Mermaid script to an image
        # Simulating an image creation
        img = Image.new('RGB', (800, 600), color=(255, 255, 255))
        draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
        draw.text((10, 10), script, fill=(0, 0, 0))
        img.save(output_file)
```

---

### **2. Creating the Gradio Web Interface**

#### **main.py**

```python
import gradio as gr
from mermaid_agent import DiagramAgent

# Initialize the DiagramAgent
agent = DiagramAgent(
    model="gpt-4-mini",
    instructions="Generate a valid Mermaid.js script for the given prompt."
)

def process_prompt(prompt):
    script = agent.generate_mermaid_script(prompt)
    output_file = "diagram.png"
    agent.render_mermaid_image(script, output_file)
    return script, output_file

# Gradio Interface
iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=process_prompt,
    inputs="text",
    outputs=["text", "image"],
    title="Mermaid Diagram Generator",
    description="Generate diagrams using Mermaid.js and smolagents!"
)

iface.launch()
```

---

## **üåü Usage**

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Open the Gradio interface in your browser.

3. Enter a prompt like:

   ```
   Create a sequence diagram for a login interaction.
   ```

4. View the generated Mermaid script and corresponding image.

## **üîß Extending the Project**

Here are a few ways to enhance this project:

- **Support for Other Diagram Types**: Extend the agent to handle flowcharts, state diagrams, etc.
- **Improved Rendering**: Use a tool like Mermaid CLI or Graphviz for more polished images.
- **Error Handling**: Add validation for generated Mermaid scripts.
- **Customization**: Allow users to choose colors, fonts, or layout styles for the diagrams.

---

## **üì¢ Conclusion**

With smolagents and Mermaid.js, generating diagrams has never been easier. This tutorial showed how to build a simple yet powerful tool for converting text prompts into dynamic visualizations. Start experimenting today and discover the potential of AI-driven workflows!
