# Creating Your First NextJS App With v0.dev

Welcome to the official repository for **Creating Your First NextJS App With v0.dev**! This repo is the future home of the video tutorial designed to help developers understand how to build a modern NextJS application using the powerful **v0.dev** platform. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, your contributions are what make this project a success.

## üíé What We Are Looking For

We are aiming to build a video tutorial explaining how to build a full-stack application using v0.dev as a code generation tool.

We would like to utilize blocks to achieve a level of functionality that gives the audience a good idea of the capabilities of the platform, while keeping it fairly concise to fit within 60 minutes of watch time.

> ### Blocks

> Blocks are unique content types which unlock new functionality in v0. When v0 generates a Block, you‚Äôll see the Block‚Äôs content in a new window on the right of your chat UI. v0 currently supports two kinds of Blocks.

> ### UI Generation Block

> UI Generation Blocks allows v0 to generate client-side UI components in React, Vue, Svelte, and HTML with CSS. You can copy or download the code for these generations as well as install them directly into your codebase via the shadcn CLI. You can also scaffold an entirely new Next.js project from your component via the CLI.

> The components v0 generates can include any client-side JavaScript, including calling browser APIs and fetching from external data sources. Just as while writing v0 can also use third-party libraries in its generations including react-three-fiber for 3D graphics.

> ### Code Execution Block

> Code Execution Blocks allow v0 to write and execute simple JavaScript code. This is particularly useful for writing and testing functions in isolation. v0 can write test cases in addition to its code output so you can ensure v0-generated code is useful.
