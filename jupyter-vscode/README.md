## Getting Started

Follow these steps to follow along the video tutorial:

1. Homebrew Installation: The process begins with installing Homebrew, a package manager for MacOS, using the command brew install in the terminal.
   - It is recommended to update and upgrade existing Homebrew installations using brew update and brew upgrade to ensure all packages are up-to-date.
2. VSCode Installation: The tutorial suggests installing VSCode using Homebrew for easier future upgrades: brew install visual-studio-code.
   - While skipping this step is possible if VSCode is already installed, utilizing Homebrew simplifies package management.
3. Development Environment Setup:
   - Create a dedicated project folder using the mkdir command. The example uses mkdir python_dev.
   - Navigate into the folder using the cd command: cd python_dev.
   - Launch VSCode within the project folder using the command code ..
4. Creating a Jupyter Notebook:
   - Inside VSCode, create a new file with the .ipynb extension (e.g., hello_world.ipynb). This automatically opens the file in the Jupyter Notebook editor.
5. Running a Simple "Hello World" Program:
   - Write a simple Python script to print "Hello World" within the notebook.
   - Running the script will prompt VSCode to install the necessary extensions: Python and Jupyter.
   - Select the desired Python environment (e.g., Python 3.12.6).
   - The successful execution of the "Hello World" program confirms the setup is complete.

## Video Summary

Briefing Doc: Setting up Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode on MacOS
This document summarizes the key steps and concepts involved in setting up Jupyter Notebooks within Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on a MacOS system, based on the provided source excerpt.

## Key Themes

- Local Development Environment: The source emphasizes the benefits of running Jupyter notebooks locally, providing control and flexibility.
- Package Management with Homebrew: Homebrew is used as the primary package manager to ensure software installation and updates are streamlined.
- VSCode as a Powerful IDE: VSCode is leveraged for its integrated Jupyter Notebook support and extensibility.

## Important Steps and Facts

1. Homebrew Installation and Setup:
   Install Homebrew using the command provided in the source or via the terminal.
   Update and upgrade existing packages using brew update and brew upgrade.
   Verify Homebrew installation by running brew commands.
   "This is just Good Housekeeping it will bring the packages to their latest versions."
2. VSCode Installation (Optional but Recommended):
   Install VSCode using Homebrew for easier future updates: brew install visual-studio-code
   Skipping this step is possible if VSCode is already installed.
3. Creating a Project Folder and Launching VSCode:
   Create a dedicated development folder: mkdir python\under\Dev
   Navigate to the folder: cd python\under\Dev
   Launch VSCode within the folder: code space . (ensure shell extension is installed)
4. Creating and Running a Jupyter Notebook:
   Create a simple notebook file: hello_world.ipynb
   Add a "Hello, World!" code snippet and execute it.
   VSCode will prompt you to install Python and Jupyter extensions.
5. Selecting a Python Environment:
   Choose a suitable Python environment for the notebook (e.g., Python 3.12.6 as mentioned in the video).
   Verify that the "Hello, World!" code runs successfully.

## Summary

The video provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a robust local environment for working with Jupyter Notebooks within VSCode on MacOS. By utilizing Homebrew for package management and leveraging VSCode's features, users can efficiently create, run, and manage their data science projects.

## FAQ: Running Jupyter Notebooks Locally in VS Code

   Install VS Code: After Homebrew is installed, use the command: brew install visual-studio-code
4. How do I create and launch a Jupyter Notebook file within VS Code?
   Create a Project Folder: Use the mkdir command in Terminal to create a dedicated folder for your project. Example: mkdir MyProject
   Open Folder in VS Code: Navigate to the folder in Terminal and run: code .
   Create a Notebook: Within VS Code, create a new file with the .ipynb extension. Example: my_notebook.ipynb
   Start Working: The notebook will open in VS Code's Jupyter Notebook editor, ready for you to write code and execute cells.
5. What are some key VS Code extensions that improve the Jupyter Notebook experience?
   Python Extension: Provides language support, debugging, and IntelliSense for Python within your notebooks.
   Jupyter Extension: Offers a rich set of features for interacting with and managing Jupyter Notebooks within VS Code.
6. How do I select a Python environment for my Jupyter Notebook?
   VS Code will typically prompt you to select a Python environment when you first run a Jupyter Notebook cell. Choose the appropriate Python interpreter that matches your project's requirements (e.g., a virtual environment). You can also manage Python environments through VS Code's settings or the command palette.

7. What is a virtual environment and why is it useful?
   A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage project dependencies separately.
   Benefits:Prevents conflicts between different projects that may require different versions of Python packages.
   Keeps your global Python installation clean.
   Makes it easier to share your project with others by clearly specifying the required dependencies.
8. Where can I find more advanced tutorials on using Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code?
   VS Code Documentation: The official VS Code documentation has comprehensive guides on working with Jupyter Notebooks: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support
