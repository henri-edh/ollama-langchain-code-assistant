## Overview

This repository is based on the YouTube video [Share and Collaborate on Colab and Jupyter.org in Under 10 Minutes!](https://youtu.be/fGVG-75B4Ig) from the **AI Software Developer** channel. The video provides a concise guide for transitioning between local and online Jupyter Notebook environments, enabling seamless collaboration and execution across platforms like VS Code and Google Colab.

## Features

- **Local Jupyter Notebook Creation**: Learn how to create, write, and execute Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.
- **Notebook to Python Script Conversion**: Export Jupyter Notebooks to Python scripts and execute them locally in VS Code.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Upload and run Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab with ease.
- **Seamless Transition**: Switch between local and online workflows effortlessly, creating and executing notebooks in both environments.

## Why This Project is Useful

This repository serves as a practical resource for developers and data scientists who need to:

- Transition between local development and online execution seamlessly.
- Collaborate with team members using shared platforms like Google Colab.
- Enhance productivity by leveraging the flexibility of Jupyter Notebook and Python script workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Jupyter extension.
- Set up a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) account.

### Steps

1. **Create a Jupyter Notebook Locally**

   - Open VS Code and create a new `.ipynb` file.
   - Write and execute code using the chosen kernel.
   - Example: Generate a bar chart of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using code from GitHub Copilot.

2. **Export the Notebook to a Python Script**

   - Use the export function in VS Code to save the notebook as a `.py` file.
   - Run the exported script locally in the VS Code terminal to verify consistent output.

3. **Run the Notebook Online (Google Colab)**

   - Upload the Jupyter Notebook to Google Colab.
   - Execute the notebook using the "Run all" command, ensuring consistent results.

4. **Reverse Workflow: Colab to Local**
   - Create a new notebook in Google Colab.
   - Download the notebook in `.ipynb` format.
   - Open and execute the notebook locally in VS Code.
